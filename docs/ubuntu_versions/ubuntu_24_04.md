# Python version en Ubuntu 24.04

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS includes CPython as the default Python interpreter. The latest version of CPython in this release is Python 3.12.3, which became available shortly before the release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS【17†source】. Additionally, PyPy, an alternative Python interpreter known for its performance, is also available in Ubuntu 24.04. However, it only includes the PyPy 3 version that corresponds to Python 3.9【18†source】【19†source】.

Therefore, if you are using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, you will primarily work with CPython, but you also have the option to install and use PyPy if you need its specific performance benefits.
