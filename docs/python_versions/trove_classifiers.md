# Trove Classifiers


On PyPI each project can specify various trove classifiers (typically in a project's setup.py through a classifier argument to setup()). There are various classifiers related to what version of Python a project can run on. E.g.:

```bash 
Programming Language :: Python :: 3

Programming Language :: Python :: 3.2
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6
Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7
```
